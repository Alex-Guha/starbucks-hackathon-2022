accuracy.py, activation.py, layer.py, loss.py, model.py, and optimizer.py are all stripped down versions of the nnfs library.
They are not my code, they are from a library. I have the actual files here because I needed to read the code to trace some stuff. Consider them all as imports.

My code is network.py and generator.py
